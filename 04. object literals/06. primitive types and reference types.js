// primitive types - numbers, strings, booleans, null, symbols
// reference types - all types of objects, object literals, arrays, functions, dates, all other objects


//stack and heap - different parts of memory
// stack - when a primitive types is created its stored in a stack, space is limited.
// heap - reference types are stored in the heap, adequate space is available, a pointer is set to the stack when a reference types is created
