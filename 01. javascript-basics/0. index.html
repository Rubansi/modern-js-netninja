    <!-- Method 1 -->
    <!-- javascript added using the script tag -->
     <!-- Javascript added inside the head tag -->
      <!-- This method is not commonly used for performance reasons -->
    <script>
        alert("hello world");

<body>
    <h1>My Web Page</h1>
    <p>This is a simple web page with JavaScript alert.</p>


    <!-- Method 2 - Javascript added in the body tag -->
     <!-- The best practice is to have the script tag at the bottom of the body tag -->
    <script>
        alert("hello world, welcome to my web page");
    </script>


    <!-- Method 3 - Javascript is added by referencing the external js script in the html head tag using the src attribute inside the script tag -->

    <script src="script.js"></script> /* This method is commonly used to keep the HTML and JavaScript code separate for better organization and maintainability */
